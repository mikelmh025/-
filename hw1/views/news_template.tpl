            A new study finds polar bears in the wild have higher metabolic rates than previously thought,
            and as climate change alter their environment a growing number of bears are unable to catch enough prey to
            meet their energy needs.<br/>
            <br/>
            The study,
            <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6375/568">published February 2 in Science</a>
            , reveals the physiological mechanisms behind observed
            declines in polar bear populations, said first author Anthony Pagano, a Ph.D Candidate at UC Santa
            Cruz. <br/>
            <br/>
            "We've been documenting declines in polar bear survival rates, body conditions, and population
            numbers over the past decade." he said,"This study identifies the mechanisms that are driving those declines
            by looking at the actual energy needs of polar bears and how often they're able to catch seals."<br/>
            <br/>
            Pagano, who is also a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), conducted the study
            as part of his Ph.D thesis research at UC Santa Cruz, where he has been working with coauthors Terrie
            Williams and Daniel Costa, both professors of ecology and evolutionary biology.

                    At the end of the last ice age, a population of polar bears was stranded by the receding ice on a
                    few islands in southeastern Alaska. Male brown bears swan across to the islands from the Alaskan
                    mainland and mated with female polar bears,eventually transforming the polar bear population into
                    brown bears.
